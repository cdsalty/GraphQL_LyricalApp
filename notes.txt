Since mLab is migrating to MongoAtlas, you'll need to make the following changes.
- First, go to your cluster in MongoAtlas, click the security tab, and then add a Atlas Admin. Remeber the username and pass as we will need them below in server.js! While here, grab your connection string by going back to your cluster, clicking the "Connect" button, "Connect Your Application", and then copy the connection string.
- Next, update Mongoose to 5.4.x. Afterward, you'll need to modify your server.js file:

const MONGO_URI = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@clusterNameHere.mongodb.net/';
if (!MONGO_URI) {
  throw new Error('You must provide a MongoAtlas URI');
}

mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
mongoose.connect(MONGO_URI, {
  authSource: 'admin',
  retryWrites: true,
  dbName: 'Lyrical-GraphQL',
  useCreateIndex: true,
  useNewUrlParser: true,
});

Current Goal:
- Create a song, then add one lyric to it
--> will need an id reference to the song that gets created. 

1. Add A song:
- mutation {
    addSong(title: "Cold Nights in Georgia") {
      id	
    }
  }
2. Retrieve the id returned
{
  "data": {
    "addSong": {
      "id": "5fd2f017fa311f296878f8c8"  <--- returned by GraphQL
    }
  }
}
3. Add a lyric to the song
- in order to do this, I must use the id returned back from graphql
